    "## 1. Game Development (Pygame) <a id=\"pygame\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/) is a popular Python library for 2D game development. It provides functionalities for rendering graphics, playing sounds, and handling user input (keyboard, mouse, joystick).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Game Loop**: A loop that runs continuously, processing events and updating the game state.\n",
    "- **Surface / Screen**: A surface on which you draw sprites, shapes, text, etc.\n",
    "- **Events**: Input (keyboard, mouse) or system events that trigger actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Pygame Skeleton\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pygame\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "pygame.init()\n",
    "# Set up the window\n",
    "screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))\n",
    "pygame.display.set_caption('My Pygame Window')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Main game loop\n",
    "clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    # Handle events\n",
    "    for event in pygame.event.get():\n",
    "        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n",
    "            pygame.quit()\n",
    "            sys.exit()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Update game state\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Draw\n",
    "    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n",
    "    # draw objects here\n",
    "\n",
    "    pygame.display.flip()\n",
    "    clock.tick(60)  # Limit to 60 FPS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- `pygame.init()` initializes all Pygame modules.\n",
    "- `pygame.display.set_mode(...)` creates the main window.\n",
    "- The **game loop** listens for events (like closing the window) and updates the screen.\n",
    "- `clock.tick(60)` ensures the loop runs at most 60 frames per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip**: You can add sprites, images, sounds, collision detection, etc., to build more complex games."

    "### 2.1 Tkinter\n",

    "\n",

    "### 2.2 PyQt\n",
    "[**PyQt**](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) (and [**PySide**](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide)) provide Python bindings for the Qt toolkit, which is used for professional-grade cross-platform GUI applications.\n",
